## `I've connected my Twitter account but iKPOP shows it as not connected`

We've been experiencing some issues with connecting Twitter accounts between version 1.0.4 and 1.0.6. 
Symptomps:
- When your account is not correctly connected if you go to the Diamonds charging station you can still see Connect With Twitter button, but after tapping it, iKPOP says that you've been already connected.
- You can't see group latest Tweet in the Group's profile
In order to fix the issue:
- Upgrade iKPOP to version 1.0.6
- Sign out
- Close the app
- Open the app
- Login with Twitter instead of Google or Apple Sign in
- Next time after Sign out you can login with any provider and your account will be correcly connected.
